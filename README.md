# Silky_TF2-Cfgs
My TF2 Configs:
This is a backup of my cfgs.
They include all my game settings (graphics, net,classes,scripts,xhairs,...).
_cfg_ folder goes in _Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\_
replace your "cfg" folder with mine or, better yet, read through my files and adapt/merge both to make them your own!

I used TF2Mate (http://clugu.com/tf2mate/) for my crosshairs and classes cfgs.
I merged the settings.cfg and autoexec.cfg file from TF2Mate with my graphics and general settings.
Some of the options in settings.cfg are also in autoexec.cfg (i'm too lazy to delete the duplicated options)

My launch options: (Steam Library>Teams Fortress 2>Preperties>Set launch options)
-novid -high -console -Thread 4 -full -w 1366 -h 768

* "-Thread x" (being x the number of physical cores of your CPU)
* "-full" (fullscreen mode)
* Change the values "-w x" and "-h y" to fit your screen resolution, x being width and y being height

Mouse settings, like "sensitivity" and "m_rawinput" and others, are both in the "settings.cfg" and "autoexec.cfg" files, because im lazy, so if youre gonna change them, make sure to change both files!
