# Silky_TF2-Cfgs
My TF2 Configs:
They include all my game settings (graphics, net,...), scripts and crosshairs.
"cfg" folder goes in "Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\"
replace the default files with mine or read through mine and adapt/merge both and make them your own!

I used TF2Mate (http://clugu.com/tf2mate/) for my crosshairs and classes cfgs.
I merged the settings.cfg and autoexec.cfg file from TF2Mate with my graphics and general settings.
Some of the options in settings.cfg are also in autoexec.cfg (i'm too lazy to delete the duplicated options)

My game launch options: (Teams Fortress 2>Preperties>Set advanced launch options)
-novid -high -console -Thread 4 -nojoy -noipx -nocrashdialog -full -w 1366 -h 768 -useforcedmparms -noforcemaccel -noforcemspd

*"-Thread x" (being x the number of physical cores your CPU has)
*"-full" (fullscreen mode)
*change the value after -w and -h to you screen/resolution width and height

Mouse settings, like "sensitivity" and "m_rawinput" and others, are both in the "settings.cfg" and "autoexec.cfg" files, so if youre gonna change them, make sure to change in both files!
